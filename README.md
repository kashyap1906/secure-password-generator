# Secure Password Generator

## Description
Secure Password Generator is a web-based tool that allows users to generate strong and secure passwords based on their specified criteria. Users can customize the password length and choose which types of characters to include (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols).

## Features
- **Customizable Password Length:** Users can specify the length of the generated password.
- **Character Set Options:** Users can choose to include or exclude lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols in their passwords.
- **Generate and Copy:** Generated passwords can be copied to the clipboard for easy use.

## Files Included
- `project.html`: Main HTML file that defines the structure of the password generator interface.
- `projectstyle.css`: CSS file containing styles for the interface elements.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file that provides the logic for generating passwords and handling user interactions.
- `projectpic.jpg`: Background image used in the interface (optional).

## How to Run
1. **Download:** Download all the files (`project.html`, `projectstyle.css`, `script.js`, `projectpic.jpg`) and save them in the same directory on your computer.
2. **Open `project.html`:** Double-click on `project.html` to open it in a web browser (preferably Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
3. **Generate Passwords:** Specify the desired password length using the input field. Check or uncheck the checkboxes for lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols based on your preferences. Click on the "Generate Password" button to generate a password.
4. **Copy Password:** Once a password is generated, it will appear in the text input field. Click the "Copy" button to copy the password to your clipboard.
